# Instructions
Congrats! With this repository you are one step closer to making a discord bot with discord.js! But there are still some things you need to know.

Getting started:
- Make sure you have created a bot user at https://discord.com/developers and that know know its token.
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- Create a new folder called Discord Bot and put it somewhere you can find it easily.
- Download the file "index.js" and put it inside the folder.

To install discord.js:
- Open up a terminal.
- Navigate to your bot's folder(the folder you created).
- If you have Node.js installed, type in "npm init"
- Follow the steps
- If you want to skip a step because what's already provided is correct, just press enter.
- Please skip the entry point, test command, git repository, keywords and license steps as they are not neccessary.
- After you are done with "npm init", type in "npm install discord.js"
- Congratulations, discord.js has been installed.

To run the bot:
- First, open up index.js and edit the line with (token) to replace it with your bot's token(it's the last line).
- Open up a terminal.
- Navigate to the bot's folder using "cd (file path)"
- If you have Node.js installed, type in "node ."
- You will know the bot is online when the message saying the bot is online appears in the terminal.

Additional Steps:
- What has already been coded will make the bot respond with "pong" when you say !ping.
- If you already know basic javascript you can figure out how to change the prefix, change what the bot does when you put the command, etc.
- Additional help and guides can be found at https://discordjs.guide and https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome
