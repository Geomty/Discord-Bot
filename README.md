# Instructions
Congrats! With this repository you are one step closer to making a discord bot with discord.js! But there are still some things you need to know.

Getting started:
- Make sure you have created a bot user at https://discord.com/developers and that know know its token.
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- Clone the repository (assuming you have git installed).

To install discord.js:
- Run "install.bat".
- After you are done with that, you can delete the file.
- Please do not run it more than once!

To run the bot:
- First, open up index.js and edit the line that says "(token)" to replace it with your bot's token (it's the last line).
- Then, run "start.bat" (unlike install.bat, you need to keep this file to run the bot and you can open it as many times as you'd like).

Additional Steps:
- What has already been coded will make the bot respond with "pong" when you say !ping.
- If you already know basic JavaScript you can figure out how to change the prefix, change what the bot does when you put the command, etc.
- Additional help and guides can be found at [https://discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide) and [https://discord.js.org/#/docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs)
